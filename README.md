# Shared-Memory-Tera-Sort
Implemented a Multi-threaded application using Java and Chameleon Cloud testbed that is flexible enough to handle different types of storage and compute resources. The sort system  will detect the workload size and sorts with the best approach possible (in memory for small datasets and external for larger datasets).
